# BinarySearchTree
Implements a binary search tree utilizing linked lists

Code is written in C++, compiled with g++

'binary_search.cpp' is the main test driver

'BinarySearchTree.cpp', 'BinarySearchTree.h', 'BinaryNodeTree.cpp', 'BinaryNodeTree.h', 'BinaryNode.cpp', 'BinaryNode.h', 
'BinaryTreeInterface.h', 'NotFoundException.cpp', 'NotFoundException.h', 'PrecondViolatedExcep.cpp' and 'PrecondViolatedExcep.h'
are all source code and header files used to implement the binary search tree

To compile, simply type and enter the 'make' command in terminal which uses makefile and creates an executable file

Executable file is named 'run'
